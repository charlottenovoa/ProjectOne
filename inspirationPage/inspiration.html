         <h1>Who Inspires Me</h1>
         <h3><b>Kep1er</b></h3>
         <div id="kep1">
            <img src="img/kep1eralbums.png" alt="Collage of four of Kep1er's albums showcasing their design. Features their Tipi Tap, Lovestruck, Troubleshooter and Kep1going On albums">
            <div>
                <p class="kep1blurb">Although picking K-Pop groups is a strange place to draw inspiration, 
                oddly they helped me choose this major. I put Kep1er first because they are my favorite
                group and I found them partly because I loved their album design. The one that I loved first was the 
                pink version of Lovestruck as seen in the top righ of the collage on the left. The elements they used in that album specifically
                really made me want to get it. </p>

            <div>
                <p class="illitblurb">Even though they are a recent debut, I think that their concept and design has to be one of my favorites. 
                I look forward to seeing every new release from them. Their design throughout their albums is very creative, like the camera albums 
                you can see on the left. I have the pink one and it even comes with a keychain, holographic stickers, and more. It looks almost holographic which
                I find very exciting. Overall, their concept is very well though out and very interesting to see.  </p>

            <div>
                <p class="heartblurb">A member of the group Ive, I gained inspiration from the way she posts on Instagram. I love the way she
                    edits her photos and it has inspired me to be more creative in the way I use my social medias. She tends to use a lot of extra graphics and drawings to
                    enhance her photos. I also really like how she uses her digital camera to take a lot of her pictures. It's actually a Japanese specific camera that she
                    has in pink. It's the Sony Cybershot W810 and I really like the quality and style it gives her photos. </p>
