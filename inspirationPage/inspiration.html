         <h1>Who Inspires Me</h1>
         <h2>Charlotte Novoa</h2>
         <h3><b>Kep1er</b></h3>
         <p>Although picking K-Pop groups is a strange place to draw inspiration, 
            oddly they helped me choose this major. I put Kep1er first because they are my favorite
            group and I found them partly because I loved their album design.</p>

        <h3><b>Illit</b></h3>
         <p>Even though they are a recent debut, I think that their concept and design has to be one of my favorites. 
            I look forward to seeing every new release from them.</p>

        <h3><b>Naoi Rei</b></h3>
            <p>A member of the group Ive, I gained inspiration from the way she posts on Instagram. I love the way she
                edits her photos and it has inspired me to be more creative in the way I use my social medias.</p>
