         <p>My favorites do change from time to time, but right now the Sugarbunnies are my favorites because 
            I really like all the different colors of bunnies as well as the aesthetic they are associated with. The rest of
        the list is based on how much I like the character visually and what their sort of vibe is. </p>

        <h3><em>Places I'd Like to Visit</em></h3>
         <img src="img/map.jpg" alt="Clipart of a teal map with a white background depicting planes travelling all around the world.">
         <ul>
            <a href="https://www.nicaragua.com/travel/"><li>Nicaragua</li></a>
            <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/destinations/kanto/tokyo/"><li>Tokyo, Japan</li></a>
            <a href="https://english.visitseoul.net/"><li>Seoul, South Korea</li></a>
            <a href="https://www.visitlondon.com/"><li>London, England</li></a>
            <a href="https://www.visiticeland.com/"><li>Iceland</li></a>

         </ul>
         <p>For most of these, I'd like to visit because they have something that interests me, or I'd like to experience
            their culture. However, I wanted to specifically highlight Nicaragua because that is where my Grandparents immigrated from and 
            I really want to visit to see what it's like. </p>
