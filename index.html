         <p>Hello! I'm Charlotte Novoa and I am currently a 19 year old sophomore at San Francisco State studying Visual Communication Design (Graphic Design). I like going to concerts, learning new languages, 
            crafting and baking in my free time. I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and have done all of my schooling here as well. I am half white and half hispanic,
            with my family being from Nicaragua.</p>
